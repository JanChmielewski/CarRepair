### To do in this page:

- [x] change the VIN error message to display right under the VIN num field
- [x] fix the date problem
- make the logic for save button
- [x] improve the vin number input protection (must contain numbers)
- [x] make the client and model field protection (must be less than X characters)
- (to consider) remove the phone number formatting - idk, something's still not working, maybe later
- clean up
