## üßê About

This document provides a comprehensive guide to the Car Repair Management System, a web-based application designed to
streamline the process of managing car repairs in a garage or car repair shop. The system is built using a combination
of modern technologies including Java, Spring Boot for the backend, and JavaScript with React for the frontend.

### Purpose

The Car Repair Management System is designed to help car repair shops manage their operations more efficiently. It
provides functionalities such as tracking the repair status of cars, managing client information, and user management.
The system is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, reducing the time spent on administrative tasks and allowing
repair shops to focus more on their core business - repairing cars.

### System Overview

The system is divided into two main parts: the backend, which is responsible for data management and business logic, and
the frontend, which provides a user interface for interacting with the system. The backend is built using Java and the
Spring Boot framework, providing a robust and scalable solution for data management. It uses a PostgreSQL database for
data
storage, with Hibernate as the ORM tool for data manipulation. The frontend is built using JavaScript and the React
library, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface. It communicates with the backend through a RESTful API,
allowing for real-time data updates and a seamless user experience.

### Document Structure

This document is divided into several sections, each focusing on a different aspect of the system. The sections include
a detailed description of the system architecture, a guide to setting up and running the system, a comprehensive list of
system features, and a guide to troubleshooting common issues.

## üèÅ Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the Car Repair Management System, you need to ensure that the following software is installed on your
machine:

### Backend

- **Java**: The backend of the system is built using Java. You need to have Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or
  above installed. You can download it from
  the [official Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

- **Gradle**: The project uses Gradle as a build tool. You can download it from
  the [official Gradle website](https://gradle.org/install/).

  properly configured. You can download it from the [official PostgreSQL website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

### Frontend

- **Node.js**: The frontend of the system is built using JavaScript and React, which require Node.js to run. You need to
  have Node.js version 14 or above installed. You can download it from
  the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

- **npm or Yarn**: These are package managers for Node.js. The project can be built using either npm or Yarn. npm is
  included with Node.js, but if you prefer to use Yarn, you can download it from
  the [official Yarn website](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install).

- **Git**: The project is version-controlled with Git. You need to have Git installed to clone the project repository.
  You can download it from the [official Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
